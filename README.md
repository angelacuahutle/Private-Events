# Private-Events
A rails Private-Events project
> The main goal of this project was to put in practice the main concepts of Associations in rails. Mainly, given the main character (the user), the events and invitations can be created with the user in mind; the user can attend an event, can create an event, can delete, etc. Find it at https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations
